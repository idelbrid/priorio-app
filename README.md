# Priorio

This is a solo side project by Ian Delbridge! In one repo, I plan to build a web app using Django for URL resolution, web page scaffolding, and ORM design, React.js for front-end design, other goodness for assorted backend work, like maybe Redis, etc., something for logs?, and Docker for isolated/portable development.

The idea for the app is as follows: If you have learned a foreign language, you have probably gotten to the stage where you know a lot of words, but there are just so many more words out there! Which ones should you focus on? The answer is simply the words that are most common in the corpuses you need to undertand. Priorio is a simple language-learning app where you can select the language you are learning, select the corpus most relevant to you, and begin learning the words in order of importance. We plan to provide a simple way to memorize words in app using a flashcard-like design, automatically determining when you've learned a word and when you need to review it.
